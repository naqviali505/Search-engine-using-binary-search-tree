# Search-engine-using-binary-search-tree

Implement the search engine using a Binary Search Tree. The basic idea here is to have each node 
store a keyword, along with associated list of URLs. It would be helpful to implement your BST 
using a class, with left and right child pointers, similar to what was done in the lectures. All you 
have to do here is implement the insert, search, and delete operations that were explained. All 
these operations are required for only keywords.
